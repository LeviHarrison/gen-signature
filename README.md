# gen-signature

It seems that DCO is everywhere now, and with that comes the need for signed commits - everywhere.
One place I always find myself caught is in the Github Web UI, trying to make a quick change, and ending up forgetting or messing up the signature, breaking checks and requiring an `amend`ment to the commit.
So, I made this simple website to help generate the signature.
